# NYC Car Crash Data
## Making Intersections Safer for Pedestrians
This is a joint project by Andrew Ozbun and Cassie Nutter

### The Data
The data for this project was found on the data.gov website.


### Objective
We are analyzing crash data from the past 5+ years in NYC where pedestrians were either injured or killed.  Our goal is to analyze the cause of the accidents and attempt to get a machine learning model to predict the cause of the accidents.  In doing this, the trajectory is to uncover and analyze potential hazards that could be avoided.  Subsequently, we are aiming to make suggestions that would improve the safety and conditions for pedestrians in New York City.
